# Owlet
Owlet provides a handy interface for ontologies for use in your Python application. It automatically generates symbols for URIs based on the ontology terms themselves. Currently the Sequence Ontology (SO) and Systems Biology Ontology are supported.

For example:
```
>>> from owlet import SO
RDFLib Version: 5.0.0
>>> print(SO.promoter)
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/SO_0000167
>>> print(SBO.systems_biology_representation)
http://biomodels.net/SBO/SBO_0000000
```
These symbols are not hard-coded, rather they are dynamically generated by querying the appropriate ontology endpoints. Alternatively an ontology can be imported from a local OWL file.

Additionally ontologies have methods that allow for other types of inference.
```
>>> SO.getTermByURI('http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/SO_0000167')
'promoter'
```

An interface for a new ontology can be configured as follows, thus allowing for dynamic lookup of terms and URIs. 
```
my_ontology = Ontology(endpoint='http://myendpoint.org/sparql#', path='./ontologies/my_ontology.owl')
```
